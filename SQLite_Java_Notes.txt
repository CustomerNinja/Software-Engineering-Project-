There are precompiled executable binaries for Windows that defintely work.
You may have to compile your own Mac OS files, however.

The link to the .JAR that you'll need is at the first bullet point under Installation.
The easiest way to get it working for our code is to just copy the .JAR file into:
	[whatever-your-JRE-file-path-is]/lib/ext
for example, on my Windows 10 laptop, the folder is:
	C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_151\jre\lib\ext
Just copy the .JAR straight in there and you should be good to go.


NinjaDB.db (the Database):
	Make sure you have the NinjaDB.db database file in the 
top level folder for your NetBeans/Eclipse project.  It should
be the folder where you see the "src" folder, but NOT within "src".
for example:
	C:\Users\JTS\Documents\NetBeansProjects\pos
